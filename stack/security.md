# Security Considerations

## Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit credentials to git
2. **OAuth Scopes**: Request only necessary permissions
3. **HTTPS**: Required for production deployment
4. **CORS**: Configure properly for API routes
5. **Data Privacy**: Ensure user-specific data is isolated and protected

## Backup & Restore Security

Refer to `design/file-operations.md` for app-specific backup and restore security considerations.
